# Week 1
The group was formed and elected the Scrum Master to be Brian. The group also looked through every project and created a list of projects we thought were interesting and had the technical knowledge to complete. We eventually decided on P20 (Woolworths/Coles Collectables Exchange Management System). We sent this project preference to our tutor, as well as some additional projects as a backup. The group also setup a Jira site.
# Week 2
The group worked on the Project Proposal. The main tasks that were completed included researching simliar existing platforms and identifying any limitations/potential improvements that could be made. Based on the research conducted, the group then developed a list of objectives the project aimed to complete. User stories were then written to demonstrate how the platform would meet the previously outlined objectives. The group also started planning out the UI using Storyboards, in order to depict how users will interact with the system. A start was also made on the System Architecture Diagram, after the group had agreed on what technology stack to use.
