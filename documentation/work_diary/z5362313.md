# z5362313 Work Diary

## Week 1
Group was formed and named ("Many Men"), with Brian as our Scrum Master. The Jira site was also created and everyone invited to a collaborative planning Google doc. We chose topic 20 (Woolworths Coles Collectables Management System) as our project idea. We considered and brainstormed the what infrastucture will we use; currently favouring a Node/Express backend with React frontend. We will use discord as our primary means of communication.
