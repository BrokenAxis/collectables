# Work Diary - Brian Huang - z5362306

## Week 1

We formed our group (ManyMen) and I was elected as Scrum Master. We looked through each project and created a list of projects we thought we could tackle. We decided on P20 (Woolworths/Coles Collectables Exchange Management) and sent this to our tutor. I followed up with the tutor as he asked for more preferences from us. We also setup a Jira site for our project and I setup a rough scaffold for the Jira Project.

## Week 2

I organised a Teams for all the teams doing the P20 project and created a Google Docs for us to compile our questions for our first client meeting. We setup the Github Repo with a very basic scaffold and I setup basic Jira tasks to work on the project proposal. We worked on the project proposal where I researched existing platforms and split our client requirements into user stories. We also came up with a few new user stories that could be seen as novel when compared to existing platforms. I also did some research into our technology stack and created a rough System Architecture Diagram. We also started planning the UI on the storyboards.

## Week 3

I finalised and submitted the proposal to be marked after asking the team to review it. I transferred all the user stories onto Jira and assisted with miscellaneous tasks such as adding to the interface flow diagram, adding research into existing systems and creating the system architecture diagram. I also created subtasks for each user story and assigned them to different people in the team. I started setting up the infrastructure for the project, such as getting `eslint prettier jest` setup as well as the frameworks we were using.

## Week 4

We started the first sprint of the project. I helped around with team member's questions regarding clarification and technical help. I also started coding the frontend of the website by setting up authentication, login page, signup page and the dashboard. I helped with debugging and rewriting the backend code.
