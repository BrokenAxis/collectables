# Work Diary - Brian Huang - z5362306

## Week 1

We formed our group (ManyMen) and I was elected as Scrum Master. We looked through each project and created a list of projects we thought we could tackle. We decided on P20 (Woolworths/Coles Collectables Exchange Management) and sent this to our tutor. I followed up with the tutor as he asked for more preferences from us. We also setup a Jira site for our project and I setup a rough scaffold for the Jira Project.

## Week 2

I organised a Teams for all the teams doing the P20 project and created a Google Docs for us to compile our questions for our first client meeting. We setup the Github Repo with a very basic scaffold and I setup basic Jira tasks to work on the project proposal. We worked on the project proposal where I researched existing platforms and split our client requirements into user stories. We also came up with a few new user stories that could be seen as novel when compared to existing platforms. I also did some research into our technology stack and created a rough System Architecture Diagram. We also started planning the UI on the storyboards.
