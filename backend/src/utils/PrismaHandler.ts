   *  This is ZenStack's implementation of RLS.
   *  Essentially there are permissions in the schema.zmodel in root directory that handles permissions
   *
   *  For example: @@allow('view', auth() == user)
   *
   *  Querying a normal Prisma client with await prisma.profile.findMany({}) will return all records even
   *  those that don't belong to the user. However, now that our Prisma client is wrapped in ZenStack's,
   *  if we query, we only get the records that belong to the user.
   *
   *  There are more examples in the schema.zmodel file.
   *
   *  @@allow('update,delete', auth() == user) means that only the user can update or delete their own records.
   *  Most of these are pretty self-explanatory. If you encounter an error / bug where your query doesn't
   *  return everything / what you want, check the schema.zmodel file to see if there are any restrictions
   *  applied to your query!
